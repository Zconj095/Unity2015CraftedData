//The selected code is part of a Unity C# script that implements a weather system that changes the color of the directional light and the skybox based on the time of day. The script has several public variables that define the colors used for each time of day and the materials for the different skyboxes.

//The Update method is called every frame and updates the time variable. It also calculates the time of day as an angle based on the current time and the day length. The directional light is rotated based on this angle.

//The UpdateEnvironment method is called to update the light color and intensity and the skybox based on the time of day angle. The method checks if the angle is less than 90 degrees, which means it is morning. If so, the light color is lerped between the night color and the morning color based on the angle, and the intensity is lerped between 0 and 1. The current skybox is set to the morning skybox.

//The method continues to check for other time of day conditions, lerping the light color and intensity and setting the current skybox accordingly. For example, if the angle is between 90 and 180 degrees, which means it is noon, the light color is lerped between the morning color and the noon color, and the intensity is set to 1. If the angle is between 180 and 270 degrees, which means it is evening, the light color is lerped between the noon color and the evening color, and the intensity is lerped between 1 and 0.3. If the angle is greater than or equal to 270 degrees, which means it is night, the light color is lerped between the evening color and the night color, and the intensity is lerped between 0.3 and 0.

//The UpdateAmbientLight method is called from UpdateEnvironment and updates the ambient light color based on the time of day angle. The method checks if the angle is less than 90 degrees, which means it is morning, and lerps the night ambient color and the morning ambient color based on the angle. If the angle is between 90 and 180 degrees, which means it is noon, the noon ambient color is used. If the angle is between 180 and 270 degrees, which means it is evening, the evening ambient color is used. If the angle is greater than or equal to 270 degrees, which means it is night, the night ambient color is used.

//Overall, the code in the selected code is responsible for changing the appearance of the game based on the time of day, including the color of the directional light, the skybox, and the ambient light.
