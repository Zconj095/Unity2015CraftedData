//The selected code is part of a Unity C# script that updates the environment based on the time of day. The script uses the timeOfDayAngle variable to determine the current time of day and adjusts the lighting and skybox accordingly.

//The script has four variables: timeOfDayAngle, dayLengthInSeconds, morningColor, and nightColor. These variables are used to store the current time of day angle, the length of a day in seconds, the colors of the morning and night skyboxes, and the directional light.

//The UpdateEnvironment method is where the script's logic is implemented. It uses an if-else statement to check the current time of day angle and set the appropriate lighting and skybox for morning, day, evening, and night.

//The script also has two private variables: time and intensity. These variables are used to calculate the current time and intensity of the directional light.
